DECK-
	- 5 heroes, AB carrier chosen in deckbuilding.
	- 30 cards in deck (maybe up to 60), max 2 of. Can choose 1 or 2 sigs, always minimum 1.
	- Up to 10 cards in item deck, min 5, max 1 of.


GAMEPLAY-

	- Combat and support rows. Tower/Ancient/Mana always in middle support row slot.
		- Tower/Ancient "supports" hero and improvement placement in all other support slots.
		- Tower also supports the 1 combat slot (unit placement) above it (until Tower is destroyed). Heroes and improvements in support row support unit placement in combat slot above them as well.

 	-COMBAT ROW
		- Melee Creep (1 1) spawn: 1 spawns for the side that has least units in combat row, or 1 spawns for each side if equal number of units (empty = equal too).
			Melee Creeps will try to spawn closest to the middle slot (if 50-50% then choose one randomly).
			For the duration of Night, all melee creeps get +2 +2 and become Mega Melee Creeps (with changed art).
			If your Tower is destroyed, opponent's Melee Creeps will always be Mega and yours will always\* be non-Mega (and let's as well do it so that those Megas always spawn for opponent, every round, regardless of that previous unit checking rule (and if opponent's tower destroyed as well, both sides have this Mega rule)).
		- When both players pass, both lanes "combat" at the same time (not lane by lane like A2). If "draw" - count gold, player with most gold wins, if equal gold - then actual draw.

	-SUPPORT ROW and RANGE
		- Biggest benefit with Support row is that when playing cards (not abilities or items) from it, it costs 1 mana less for each (so if in range game should automatically prefer to cast/preview from Support row hero instead of Combat hero, for 1 less mana). With no specification, card and ability effects can reach from everywhere in a lane, but with a "Melee" specification on a cast, you'll only be able to reach the next other row - so it checks for 3 different rows: your support row, the total combat row and enemy support row. So you can't reach enemy's Support row from your own Support row with a "Melee" cast (this rule is probably enough for this all).

	-UNIT/IMPROV DEPLOY
		- Heroes and Creeps can be placed near other allies, opposite to enemy units (defending), above support row supported slots, and on top of your own allies (same rules as A2). Heroes can as well be deployed anywhere in Support rows, but not creeps. Improvements can only be deployed in Support rows.
		- First Hero deploy phase: Players simultaniously first deploy a hero in either of their support rows, then deploy a hero in their respective offlanes and finally a hero in safe lanes. (There is already 1 melee creep for each side in both lanes before deploying starts) - Meaning you can deploy in either of the three middle slots in combat row (or the first deployed support hero's supported slot above it) (and anywhere in support row).

		(Creeps, Heroes = Units)
		(Improvements, Towers, Ancients = Structures)

	-HERO ROW/LANE MOVEMENT
		- This is not set in stone, but let's do for now: A hero can move from Support row to Combat row for 2 mana, same deploy requirements as when deploying a unit (but it can't support itself, can't be placed in the slot above it, if something else doesn't support that slot).
		A hero can move from Combat row to any Support slot for 1 mana (and it can as well destroy its own improvements if placed on top of them, and let's make it possible to swap heroes like this, but then costing additional 2 mana, so swapping hero with hero like this is total 3 mana cost). A combat row hero can't move to support row or be swapped if that hero is targeted (by attack arrows) by 2 or more enemy units.
		- Another benefit with Support row is that you can move Heroes from it to the other lane's Support row, let's say for 3 mana. What happens then is that hero disappears from the slot, and there is a hero icon with an arrow where it's moving, between the support rows. It can only arrive to the other lane at the start of next round (the exact slot is secret for opponent).
		- These moves have 1 round cooldown, and are displayed as a negative Status effect (circle top of the hero) (and since it's negative, it can be purged by you).

	-DAY/NIGHT CHANGES
		- First round is Day, second is Night, aso alternating.
			- Rune spawns only at start of Day (except the first round).
			- In final version there is more advanced and dynamic Light filtering for board and cards, as well based on total mana left, but for this first version it's enough to dim the board background after Shopping phase - when Night starts, remove filter same time when Day starts next round. (So filter changes at start of new round, for now.)
			- Melee Creeps get +2 +2 when Night starts and -2 -2 when Night ends (or right after combat phase) (in advanced light filter it will already be near dawn at round end). So if Mega Creeps are 2 hp or less when Night ends, they die.
			- Players draw 2 cards at start of Day and 1 at start of Night (except first round, players start with 5 cards).

	-GOLD and INTERACTIONS
		- Each player starts game with 3 gold. At the end of each round (after combat phase) the remaining unused Mana from both your lanes is converted to Gold (So a player can potentially have 9 gold after combat, aso, not counting kills or other things).
		(Mega/Melee Creeps bounty is 1, all other creeps have bounty of 2)
		(Hero bounty is 5 (AB hero has reduced bounty of 3))
		(Improvement bounty is 3)

	-MANA and INTERACTIONS
		- Each player starts with 3 mana in each lane, refreshing and increasing by 1 every round.
		- When Tower (60 hp) in lane falls, it disappears, mana pool is moved to the place the Tower stood, and behind it Ancient (90 hp) comes into view (similar in appearacnce to Tower). Not final but: Mana then additionally becomes Ancient Armor, and defends 1 hp for each 2 mana (if 3 (odd) mana left, still defends only 1 hp and is used up if opponent damage is 2 or more). Defends during a round and combat phase for all non-piercing damage to tower.

	-AB HERO
		- Would be chosen during deckbuilding, but for now just some hero we choose later.
		- When it's in play and its color is not disabled, it acts as a source of color for all other non-color-disabled casters on your side, in both lanes.
		- At AB hero deploy, your AB hero is randomly\* assigned 3 stats (+1 +1 +1), attack, armor or hp. But no stat can be assigned more than +2. AB hero has some special glow behind it I guess, in UI and on board, everywhere, so it can be identified. It doesn't have to be one of first 3 heroes.
		- Has reduced bounty of 3 (-2 bounty).

	-MELEE CREEP AGGRO
		- At any time any hero targets (with arrow) opponent's hero, opponent's mega/melee creeps that are in range will target that hero. And this can't be changed by that hero getting a new non-opponent-hero target. But can change otherwise, and same creeps can aggro other and same opponent heroes same round, if that condition is triggered again.

	-HAND
		- Max hand size is 12 (or more if it's easy to do so with js, but probably not in scope this time). If 12 or close, should have similar overflow pile like A2.

	-SHOPPING PHASE (probably not in scope for this time)
	 - I guess happens at the end of round, before new round starts.

	-COMBAT/PLAY PREVIEWS (not sure if completely in scope)
		- Just like all A games do it, there is a continuous preview of upcoming combat phase, as well as a preview when you cast almost anything (that which instantly modifies all kinds of stats).
		Also all kinds of available, relevant placement previews when doing related cast.


OTHER-

	-HERO FOUNTAIN
		- Between Player Info Area and Hand.

	-ARMOR
		- All damage instances are first reduced by unit armor (except piercing) and then for each damage instance (including piercing) Armor is reduced by 1 for this round. So Axe has 2 armor, it gets damaged by anything at all, it gets -1 armor, if damaged once more, -1 again, until 0.

	-ABILITY and ITEMS DISPLAY ON HEROES
		- Talked about this before, so each hero has one row of 3 icons, 1 Ability and 2 items. There can be a small flattened arrow at the bottom of ability icon which means that this hero has additional Passive abilities, and both Active and Passive ability descriptions are displayed when you hover over Ability icon. (Other "Enchancements" are displayed right over this row. And other Status effects are displayed in circles at the top of hero card, in row of 4 this time, since they can be smaller (similar to A2)).
		- Heroes/Creeps/Improvements have different layout in Hand and on Board (for example everything is wider on board and Creeps don't have same kind of description board, but on hover). Different css.

	-LAST CARD PLAYED (probably not in scope this time)

	-STUNS and SILENCES
		- Will probably be turn-based not round-based like now (but don't carry over to next round).
		- Silence no longer disables active items.
		- Disarms (and active ability and active item Mute (new)), and all other effects still round-based.
		- These are displayed as Status effects on top of the hero, and Stuns and Silences should somehow as well display its turn cooldown (not really sure how, and since they are kind of small, try for bottom left corner of the whole box of the Status effect circle (so it uses as well that empty space outside of the circle)).
